### Context
Need for a reliable database that can handle complex relationships and JSON data.

### Decision
Use PostgreSQL with Prisma as ORM.

### Rationale
- ACID compliance
- JSON/JSONB support
- Excellent performance
- Strong indexing capabilities
- Prisma provides type safety

### Consequences
- Need for database maintenance
- Migration management required
- Connection pooling setup needed

## ADR 4: Microservices Architecture
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
System needs to be scalable and maintainable as features grow.

### Decision
Split core functionalities into microservices.

### Rationale
- Independent scaling
- Isolated deployments
- Technology flexibility
- Better fault isolation

### Consequences
- Increased operational complexity
- Need for service discovery
- API gateway required

## ADR 5: WebSocket for Real-Time Communication
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
Need for real-time bidirectional communication between client and server.

### Decision
Use WebSocket protocol for real-time features.

### Rationale
- Full-duplex communication
- Lower latency than HTTP polling
- Native browser support
- Scalable with proper infrastructure

### Consequences
- Need for fallback mechanisms
- Connection management overhead
- Additional server resources required

## ADR 6: Docker Containerization
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
Need for consistent development and deployment environments.

### Decision
Use Docker for containerization.

### Rationale
- Consistent environments
- Easy scaling
- Simplified deployment
- Isolated dependencies

### Consequences
- Container orchestration needed
- Image management required
- Learning curve for team

## ADR 7: JWT for Authentication
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
Need for stateless authentication mechanism.

### Decision
Use JWT tokens for authentication.

### Rationale
- Stateless authentication
- Scalable across services
- Built-in expiration
- Standard encryption

### Consequences
- Token size considerations
- Refresh token strategy needed
- Revocation complexity

## ADR 8: ELK Stack for Logging
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context

### Decision
Implement ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack.

### Rationale
- Centralized log management
- Powerful search capabilities
- Real-time monitoring
- Visual analytics

### Consequences
- Resource intensive
- Requires maintenance
- Storage considerations

## ADR 9: Redis for Caching
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
Need for fast data access and temporary storage.

### Decision
Use Redis for caching and session storage.

### Rationale
- High performance
- Built-in data structures
- Pub/sub capabilities
- Distributed locking

### Consequences
- Memory management needed
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Additional infrastructure required

## ADR 10: AWS as Cloud Provider
**Date**: 2024-01-06

### Context
Need for reliable cloud infrastructure.

### Decision
Use AWS as primary cloud provider.

### Rationale
- Comprehensive service offering
- Global infrastructure
- Strong security features
- Integration capabilities

### Consequences
- Vendor lock-in considerations
- Cost management needed
- Team AWS expertise required
